   - Enter your weight in kilograms (e.g., 72.5).

2. **Calculate Your BMI:**
   - The calculator computes your BMI using the formula:
     ```
     BMI = weight / (height * height)
     ```
   - The result is rounded to one decimal place for precision.

3. **BMI Categories:**
   - **Underweight:** BMI < 18.5
   - **Normal Weight:** 18.5 ‚â§ BMI < 24.9
   - **Overweight:** 24.9 ‚â§ BMI < 29.9
